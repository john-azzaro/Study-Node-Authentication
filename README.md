## What is the Node Authentication and Encryption Study?
The Node Authentication and Encryption Study is an examination of security and data confidentiality using the bcrypt encryption library.  In this study, a basic express application
demonstrates how to post a user name and password to a locally stored user database, login with a user name and password, and show how bcrypt helps add a high level of security to the
authentication process.

## What is Authentication?
Authentication is used for identifying users and providing different access to content depending on their id.  For example, suppose you have a commerce website that requires users to register and sign into an an account to purchase items. The application would provide a registration and login form with credentials such as a name and password to verify that the user is who they say they are.
